# Zip Saber

A Beat Saber Mod That allows you to drag and drop .zip/map files into the beat saber window and extract and import to the CustomWipLevels folder before refreshing song list.


I will be fully honest this mod was mainly created with AI, I'm not that great at coding lol so if u wanna make a part to it go for it, but do message me if u can lol

## Dependencies
BSIPA ^4.2.2
SongCore ^3.9.0

## Plans For the Mod
Adding A UI that asks you if you want the .zip file to go into CustomLevels or CustomWipLevels

## What if I want to compile this myself?
I used .Net SDK 6.0.428
And Visual Studio Code
